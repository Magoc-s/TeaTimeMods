# TeaTimeMods
The collection of mods/plugins the Teatime minecraft server is using, as well as how to install them!

## Installation

### For Windows
Step 1: Download the [fabric installer.](../blob/main/fabric-installer-0.10.2.exe) (This is what makes the mods work.)
  - Source: (https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)

Step 2: Run the installer, and select **1.18.1** as the game version, and leave the "loader" version as it is. You shouldn't have to change the install location either. Now click install.

Step 3: Download the [mods zip.](../blob/main/teatime_mods.zip)

Step 4: Extract the mods from this zip folder into your mods folder in your '.minecraft' directory.
  - If you are unsure how to do this, then about 1/3 of the way down [this website](https://www.alphr.com/fabric-install-mods/) explains it.

Here's what my mods folder looks like. You can leave the zip file in there if you would like, it doesn't matter.

Step 5 (Optional): In your minecraft launcher, go to the 'Installations' tab and press the three dots on the newly created Fabric loader installation.
  - Step 5.1: Edit the advanced options and modify the `-Xmx2G` value in the 'Launch Arguments' section. By default minecraft has 2GB of RAM allocated to it (indicated by the 2). Change this to how ever much ram you want to allocate to minecraft. General rule of thumb is half your total available ram.
   

### For Mac
Step 1: Download the 'Universal JAR' from the [Fabric Installer Download page](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).

Step 2: Run the JAR file, and select **1.18.1** as the game version, and leave the "loader" version as it is. You might have to change the install location to point towards your minecraft folder (whereever your minecraft is installed). Now click install. 
  - Note: if Mac doesn't know how to run the Jar file, you may need to install the Java runtime environment first. You can follow the comments on this page for some help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16828076/how-to-run-a-jar-in-mac
